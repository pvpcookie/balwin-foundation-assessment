# Core Coding Skills Assessment Suite

## Overview

This comprehensive assessment suite evaluates core coding competencies across three fundamental areas:

1. **Assessment 1: SOLID Principles** - Object-oriented design principles
2. **Assessment 2: Algorithms** - Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking  
3. **Assessment 3: Data Structures** - Understanding of fundamental data structures

Each assessment is designed to test both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills that are essential for software development.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
```bash
# Clone the assessment suite
git clone [REPO_URL_TO_BE_FILLED_IN]
cd code-test

# Or download as ZIP and extract
```

- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Setup All Assessments
```bash
# Navigate to each assessment and install dependencies

- Dependency management

**Key Tasks:**
- Refactor violating code to follow SRP
- Implement OCP-compliant extensible design
- Fix LSP violations in inheritance hierarchies
- Create focused interfaces following ISP
- Apply DIP through dependency injection

### Assessment 2: Algorithms (Estimated Time: 3-4 hours)

**Skills Evaluated:**
- Algorithmic thinking and problem-solving
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Implementation of fundamental algorithms
- Optimization and efficiency considerations

**Algorithm Categories:**
- **Sorting**: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort
- **Searching**: Binary Search, Linear Search
- **Dynamic Programming**: Fibonacci, Coin Change, Knapsack
- **Graph**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm
- **String Processing**: Palindromes, LCS, Pattern Matching
- **Mathematical**: GCD, Prime Numbers, Fast Exponentiation
- **Tree**: Traversals, BST Operations, Depth Calculation

### Assessment 3: Data Structures (Estimated Time: 4-5 hours)

**Skills Evaluated:**
- Understanding of data structure internals
- Implementation of core operations
- Memory management and efficiency
- Choosing appropriate structures for problems

**Data Structures Covered:**
- **Linear**: Dynamic Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue
- **Tree-based**: Binary Search Tree, Min Heap, Trie
- **Hash-based**: Hash Table with collision resolution
- **Graph**: Adjacency list with traversal algorithms

## Grading Framework

Each assessment uses a comprehensive grading framework:

### Scoring Breakdown
- **Correctness (40%)**: All tests pass, requirements met
- **Efficiency (25-30%)**: Appropriate time/space complexity
- **Code Quality (20-25%)**: Clean, readable, maintainable code
- **Understanding (10%)**: Comments and design decisions

### Performance Levels
- **Excellent (90-100%)**: All requirements met with optimal solutions
- **Proficient (80-89%)**: Most requirements met with good solutions
- **Developing (70-79%)**: Basic requirements met, some areas need improvement
- **Needs Improvement (<70%)**: Significant gaps in understanding or implementation

## Time Recommendations

### For Students
- **Total Time**: 9-12 hours across all assessments
- **Approach**: Start with Assessment 1, progress through 2 and 3
- **Strategy**: Focus on correctness first, then optimize

### For Instructors
- **Review Time**: 30-45 minutes per student per assessment
- **Focus Areas**: Look for understanding of core concepts, not just working code
- **Feedback**: Provide specific guidance on areas for improvement

## Using These Assessments

### For Educational Institutions
- Use as midterm or final projects
- Break into smaller assignments over a semester
- Adapt difficulty based on course level

### For Interview Processes
- Select specific sections based on role requirements
- Use as take-home or pair programming exercises
- Focus on problem-solving approach, not just solutions

### For Self-Assessment
- Work through assessments to identify knowledge gaps
- Use as preparation for technical interviews
- Practice implementing fundamental concepts from scratch

### Repository Structure Notes
- **Base assessments** contain empty implementation templates with TODO comments
- **Answer keys** (.answers/) contain complete reference implementations
- **Grading criteria tests** always pass to provide assessment guidelines
- **Functional tests** fail appropriately until students implement solutions
